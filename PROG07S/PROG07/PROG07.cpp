//* This program tests to see if an included "money.h" file contains   *
//* all required money class overloaded operator and member functions. *
//* The "money.h" file being tested must be in this programs folder.   *
//* If this program runs correctly after compiling and linking, the    *
//* "money.h" file does contain all required money class overloaded    *
//* operator and member functions.                                     *
//* NOTE: This program DOES NOT test the correct execution of these    *
//*       overloaded operators and member functions.  It ONLY tests    *
//*       for their presence in the included "money.h" file.           *
